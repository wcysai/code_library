        Block list that supports persistence. All indices are 0-based. All ranges are left-closed right-open. \lstinline|std::shared_ptr| is used to ease memory management. One should modify the constructor of \lstinline|block| to maintain extra information. Here we use this policy that the size of each block does not exceed \lstinline|BLOCK|, while the sum of sizes of two adjacent blocks does not less than \lstinline|BLOCK|. 

        When some operation that breaks block list property, please call \lstinline|maintain| in time to restore the property.

        maintain(): Maintain the block list property.

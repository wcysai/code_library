\subsubsection{Unweighted version}

The Burnside's lemma says that
$$ |X / G| = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} |X^g| $$
where $G$ is a group acting on $X$, $X^g$ is the set of elements in $X$ that are fixed by $g$, i.e. $X^g = \{x \in X : gx = x\}$.

The unweighted version of P\'olya enumeration theorem says that
$$ |Y^X / G| = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} m^{c_g} $$
where $m = |X|$ is the number of colors, $c_g$ is the number of the cycles of permutation $g$.

\subsubsection{Weighted version}
For permutation $\pi \in G$, if $\pi$ is a product of $k$ cycles, and the $i$th cycle has length $l_i$, let
$$ M_{\pi}(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n x_{l_i} .$$
The cycle index of $G$ is defined by
$$ P_G(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{\pi \in G} M_{\pi}(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n). $$
Given $\bm{v} = (n_1, n_2, \cdots, n_m)$ of nonnegative integers satisfying that $n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_m = n$, let $a_{\bm{v}}$ represent the number of nonequivalent $m$ coloring of the $n$ objects, where the $i$th color occurs precisely $n_i$ times. The pattern inventory is the (multivariate) generating function for the sequence $a_{\bm{v}}$: 
$$ F_G(y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_m) = \sum_{\bm{v}} a_{\bm{v}} y_1^{n_1} y_2^{n_2} \cdots y_m^{n_m} $$
The weighted version of the P\'olya's enumeration theorem says that
$$
F_G(y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_m) = P_{G}(\sum_{i=1}^m y_i, \sum_{i=1}^m y_i^2, \cdots, \sum_{i=1}^m y_i^n)$$
